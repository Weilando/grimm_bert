# Grimm BERT

This framework provides experiments for my master thesis about the _Lottery Ticket Hypothesis_.
You can use [grimm_env.yml](/grimm_env.yml) to [create a conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) with all necessary python packages.
